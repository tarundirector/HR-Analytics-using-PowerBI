- **Template Creation for Automation:**
  - I begin by creating a dynamic template to automate the preprocessing pipeline, ensuring that transformations applied to the current data are adaptable to future datasets. This approach minimizes repetitive preprocessing tasks and enhances the scalability of the dashboard.

- **Function Utilization:**
  - I incorporate functions to streamline and automate common data processing steps, facilitating efficient and consistent data preparation for Power BI. This helps in maintaining a standardized approach across various datasets.

- **DAX Measures Implementation:**
  - I prioritize the creation of comprehensive DAX measures to capture key metrics, enabling quick and flexible creation of charts and visuals on the Power BI dashboard. This ensures a robust foundation for insightful data representation.

- **Strategic UI Design:**
  - I adopt a user-centric approach by strategically placing the most critical insights in the left top corner, optimizing the user's immediate visual attention. This enhances the user experience by providing quick access to pivotal information.

- **Interactive Filters:**
  - I integrate interactive filters, such as those based on time (e.g., month), allowing users to dynamically explore and analyze data. This not only enhances usability but also empowers users to tailor their views based on specific criteria.

- **Consistent Aesthetics and Naming Conventions:**
  - I adhere to consistent aesthetics and naming conventions for charts, graphs, and filters, promoting a visually cohesive and user-friendly dashboard. This facilitates ease of understanding and navigation for users.
